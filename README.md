# Layerwise project

<a href="https://layerwise.app"><img src="https://layerwise.app/powered-by.png" alt="Powered by Layerwise" width="320" /></a>

This is the starter used for new Layerwise projects. It is a full-stack React
app built with TanStack Start and deployed to Cloudflare Workers. The template
includes Better Auth, a D1 database with Drizzle ORM, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui,
and the Layerwise preview bridge.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm check-types
pnpm build
pnpm auth:generate
pnpm db:generate --name <migration_name>
pnpm db:migrate
pnpm cf-typegen
pnpm release
```

`db:migrate` applies generated Drizzle migrations to the local D1 database.
Layerwise applies the same migrations to the project's production D1 database
during publishing.
